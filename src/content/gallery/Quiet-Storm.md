We hiked for four hours to reach this ridge, chasing the light. The weather report promised clear skies, but the mountains make their own weather.

As we crested the peak, a storm front rolled in from the north. It wasn't violent, but menacingly silent. The clouds swallowed the adjacent peaks one by one. I set up the tripod and waited.

The contrast in this scene is completely natural. The dark, brooding basalt rock against the rapidly moving mist created a scene of high drama. In post-processing, I pushed the black point to emphasize the silhouette of the ridge, aiming for an Ansel Adams-esque tonality. It reminds me that nature is indifferent to our presence—beautiful, vast, and overwhelming.
