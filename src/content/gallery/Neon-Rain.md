The air was heavy with humidity, and the neon signs buzzed with a sound that felt almost electrical against the skin. I stood on the corner of Nathan Road waiting for the downpour to start.

When it finally came, it wasn't a drizzle but a wall of water. The city transformed instantly. The asphalt became a mirror, reflecting the chaotic reds and blues of the advertisements above.

I shot this at f/1.7, 1/60s, trying to capture the exact moment a taxi's brake lights painted the wet road in crimson. The grain in the shadows is intentional—a nod to the cinematic quality of the scene, reminiscent of *Blade Runner*. There is a certain solitude in a crowd when it rains; everyone retreats into their own bubbles, shielded by umbrellas, leaving the photographer as the only observer of the collective mood.
