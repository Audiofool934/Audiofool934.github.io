There is a chaotic beauty in a modular synthesizer patch. Each cable represents a signal path, a decision, a modulation of voltage that results in sound.

This macro shot focuses on the texture of the braided cables against the brushed aluminum of the Eurorack modules. The depth of field is razor thin, drawing the eye to the connection point—the physical interface where electricity becomes music.

I love the tactile nature of this equipment. In an age of pristine software plugins, the physical resistance of plugging a cable, the friction of a knob, connects you to the creation process in a way a mouse click never can.
