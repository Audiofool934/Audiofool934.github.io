I spent the first day of 2026 revisiting the concept of Conditional Expectation.

It's fascinating how a concept often introduced as "just a formula" in introductory probability courses reveals its true geometric nature when viewed through the lens of Hilbert spaces. The [note on Conditional Expectation](/wiki/conditional-expectation-variance/) has been updated to reflect this perspective—moving away from mechanical definitions towards the intuition of orthogonal projections.

Sometimes, rewriting a note is the best way to verify if you truly understand something.
