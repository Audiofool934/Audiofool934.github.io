Excited to share that our paper, **"MUSE: Probabilistic Text-to-Music at Scale"**, has been accepted!

MUSE tackles the long-standing issue of "blurry" generation in autoregressive audio models by utilizing a Flow Matching backbone with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). We achieved state-of-the-art results in stereo 44.1kHz generation.

Huge thanks to the team for the sleepless nights optimizing the distributed training loop. Training a 3B parameter model on 128 GPUs is no small feat.
