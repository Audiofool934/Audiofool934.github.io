After months of "collecting dust" with a generic template, I finally sat down to give this site a proper identity.

### The Goal

I wanted something that reflects my work in audio and code: precise, high-contrast, and slightly "underground." The new design system "Dark Side of the Moon" is purely monochromatic.

### Key Changes

*   **Framework**: Migrated to [Astro](https://astro.build) for performance.
*   **Audio Player**: Integrated a global, persistent audio player using View Transitions. It keeps the music playing while you browse.
*   **Gallery**: Rebuilt the gallery with a focus on visual storytelling, supporting wide panoramic shots without cropping.
*   **Typography**: Switched to Inter and JetBrains Mono for that terminal aesthetic.

The result is a site that feels less like a blog and more like a digital workspace.
